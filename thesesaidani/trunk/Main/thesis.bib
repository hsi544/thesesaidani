  abstract = {The cell broadband engine (CBE) is designed to be a general purpose
	platform exposing an enormous arithmetic performance due to its eight
	SIMD-only synergistic processor elements (SPEs), capable of achieving
	134.4 GFLOPS (16.8 GFLOPS * 8) at 2.1 GHz, and a 64-bit power processor
	element (PPE). Each SPE has a 256Kb non-coherent local memory, and
	communicates to other SPEs and main memory through its DMA controller.
	CBE main memory is connected to all the CBE processor elements (PPE
	and SPEs) through the element interconnect bus (EIB), which has a
	134.4 GB/s bandwidth performance peak at half the processor speed.
	Therefore, CBE platform is suitable to be used by applications using
	MPI and streaming programming models with a potential high performance
	peak. In this paper we focus on the communication part of those applications,
	and measure the actual memory bandwidth that each of the CBE processor
	components can sustain. We have measured the sustained bandwidth
	between PPE and memory, SPE and memory, two individual SPEs to determine
	if this bandwidth depends on their physical location, pairs of SPEs
	to achieve maximum bandwidth in nearly-ideal conditions, and in a
	cycle of SPEs representing a streaming kind of computation. Our results
	on a real machine show that following some strict programming rules,
	individual SPE to SPE communication almost achieves the peak bandwidth
	when using the DMA controllers to transfer memory chunks of at least
	1024 Bytes. In addition, SPE to memory bandwidth should be considered
	in streaming programming. For instance, implementing two data streams
	using 4 SPEs each can be more efficient than having a single data
	stream using the 8 SPEs}
