	summarize, and analyze the latest research in mapping general-purpose

	that underlie general-purpose computation on graphics processors
	(GPGPU) and describe the hardware and software developments that
	have led to the recent interest in this field. We then aim the main
	body of this report at two separate audiences. First, we describe
	the techniques used in mapping general-purpose computation to graphics
	hardware. We believe these techniques will be generally useful for
	researchers who plan to develop the next generation of GPGPU algorithms
	and techniques. Second, we survey and categorize the latest developments
	in general-purpose application development on graphics hardware.},
