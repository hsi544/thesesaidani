  abstract = {Expression Templates is a C++ technique for passing expressions as
	function arguments. The expression can be inlined into the function
	body, which results in faster and more convenient code than C-style
	callback functions. This technique can also be used to evaluate vector
	and matrix expressions in a single pass without temporaries. In preliminary
	benchmark results, one compiler evaluates vector expressions at 95-99.5\%
	efficiency of hand- coded C using this technique (for long vectors).
	The speed is 2-15 times that of a conventional C++ vector class.},
